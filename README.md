# My Biggest React Project (Inspired by Flat UI Colors)

- A inspired by the website like [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers).

- It is a Big Application and as it is being hosted on the Github Pages, please wait for 2 minutes before clicking around.
    - In the past it was hosted on a great servers of Heroku but they started charging money and because of that I had to shift it to github pages. Thanks and Enjoy😊 

- Made to work with all type of Screen size.

- Made with ❤️ using React.js

- You can either go ahead and find your dream color palette.
